## about me
Open to job offers - best way to contact me is through [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abiy-fanta-3bb287258/) </br></br>
I am a 18 year old with great interesting in programs. </br>
I have 3 years of experience with programming in C++ and C# </br>
And I try to make projects that are varied and have something special between them and can be used in the future. </br>

## Project Showcase
[Abiy's Standard Library](https://github.com/Melakoo/Abiy-Cpp-Standard-Library) [C++] - A library I have created to keep all of my frequently used functions in a single area so don't have to copy and paste them constantly. It's a safer and more efficient solution instead of changing functions in all projects seperately.</br></br>

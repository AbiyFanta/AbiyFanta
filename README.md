## Project Showcase
[Abiy's Standard Library](https://github.com/Melakoo/Abiy-Cpp-Standard-Library) [C++] - A library I have created to keep all of my frequently used functions in a single area so don't have to copy and paste them constantly. It's a safer and more efficient solution instead of changing functions in all projects seperately.(work in progress, nothing uploaded yet)</br></br>

[Flappy Bird Recreation](https://github.com/Melakoo/Flappy-Bird) [Python] - A simple recreation of the hit mobile game Flappy Bird using python.</br></br>

[Minesweeper](https://github.com/AbiyFanta/Minesweeper) [HTML] - Another simple recreation of a classic game. </br></br>
